# 347. Top K Frequent Elements - Solution Analysis

**Category:** Heap | **Difficulty:** Medium | **Status:** ✅ Solved

## Current Solution Overview

### Implementation Status
- **File:** `347_top_k_frequent_elements.js`
- **Function:** `topKFrequent`
- **Approach:** Hash Map + Sort (frequency counting with correct descending sort)
- **Status:** ✅ Complete and Correct

### Current Code
```javascript
var topKFrequent = function (nums, k) {
  let seen = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    seen[nums[i]] = (seen[nums[i]] || 0) + 1;
  }

  let sorted = Object.keys(seen)
    .sort((a, b) => seen[b] - seen[a])    // ✅ CORRECT: Descending by frequency
    .map((i) => Number(i));

  return sorted.slice(0, k);
};
```

## Performance Analysis

### Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Due to full sorting of all unique elements
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - For frequency map and sorted keys array
- **Optimal Complexity:** O(n log k) time, O(n + k) space using min-heap
- **Assessment:** ✅ Correct implementation, ⚠️ Suboptimal but functional

### Algorithm Pattern
- **Category:** Hash Map + Sorting
- **Key Technique:** Frequency counting followed by sorting
- **Data Structures:** Object (hash map) for frequency counting, Array for sorting

## Test Results

### Test Summary
- **Total Tests:** 28/28 passed
- **Status:** ✅ All Pass - Perfect score!

### Test Coverage
- ✅ **README Examples**: Basic functionality verified
- ✅ **Edge Cases**: Single elements, equal frequencies, boundary conditions
- ✅ **Common Patterns**: Increasing/decreasing frequencies, mixed numbers
- ✅ **Boundary Conditions**: Min/max values, large arrays
- ✅ **Complex Scenarios**: Equal frequencies, alternating patterns, fibonacci-like frequencies

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Single element arrays
- ✅ Equal frequencies with proper tie-breaking
- ✅ Boundary conditions (min/max values)
- ✅ Large arrays with many unique elements
- ✅ Negative numbers and zero values
- ✅ Complex frequency patterns

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ Clean frequency counting logic using hash map
- ✅ Correct sorting logic with proper comparator
- ✅ Excellent edge case handling (all 28 tests pass)
- ✅ Clean, readable implementation without unused variables
- ✅ Proper use of Object.keys() and array methods
- ✅ Correct export structure for testing

### Areas for Improvement
- **Performance**: O(n log n) when O(n log k) is achievable with heap
- **Optimization**: Could use bucket sort for O(n) in some cases
- **Learning**: Could implement heap-based solution for educational value

### Code Quality
- **Correctness**: ✅ Perfect - all tests pass
- **Readability**: ✅ Clean and straightforward
- **Efficiency**: ⚠️ Functional but could be optimized

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Min-Heap (Optimal)
- **Complexity:** O(n log k) time, O(n + k) space
- **Trade-offs:** More complex implementation but better performance for small k
- **Implementation notes:** Use priority queue to maintain top k elements

### Approach 2: Bucket Sort
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space
- **Trade-offs:** Optimal time but requires extra space for buckets
- **Implementation notes:** Create buckets based on frequency counts

### Approach 3: Quick Select
- **Complexity:** O(n) average time, O(n) space
- **Trade-offs:** Best average case but O(n²) worst case
- **Implementation notes:** Partition based on frequencies

## Learning Notes

### Pattern Recognition
- **How to identify:** "Top K" problems often benefit from heap data structures
- **Common variations:** Top K elements, Kth largest/smallest, frequency-based selection
- **Key insights:** When k << n, heap-based solutions are more efficient than full sorting

### Implementation Tips
- Always verify sort comparator logic with simple examples
- For "top K" problems, consider if full sorting is necessary
- Min-heap for top K: keep heap size ≤ k, remove smallest when exceeded
- Use proper comparison functions: `(a, b) => seen[b] - seen[a]` for descending
