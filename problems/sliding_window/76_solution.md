  let freqMap = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
    freqMap[t[i]] = (freqMap[t[i]] || 0) + 1;
  }

  let minL = 0, minR = 0;
  let l = 0, r = 0;
  let min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  let window = {};
  let match = 0;

  while (r < s.length) {
    let char = s[r];

    if (freqMap[char]) {
      window[char] = 1 + (window[char] || 0);
      if (window[char] === freqMap[char]) match++;
    }

    while (match === required) {
      let current = r - l + 1;
      if (current < min) {
        minL = l;
        minR = r;
        min = current;
      }
      char = s[l];
      window[char]--;
      if (freqMap[char] && window[char] < freqMap[char]) {
        match--;
      }
      l++;
    }

    r++;
  }

  return min === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ? "" : s.slice(minL, minR + 1);
};
```

## Performance Analysis

### Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Single pass through string with two pointers
- **Space Complexity:** O(k) where k is unique characters in target string
- **Optimal Complexity:** O(n) time, O(k) space
- **Assessment:** ✅ Optimal - Perfect implementation

### Algorithm Pattern
- **Category:** Sliding Window with Two Pointers
- **Key Technique:** Dynamic window expansion/contraction with frequency matching
- **Data Structures:** Hash maps for O(1) character frequency tracking

## Test Results

### Test Summary
- **Total Tests:** All manual tests passing ✅
- **Status:** ✅ All Pass - Solution working correctly

### Verified Test Cases
```
✅ minWindow("ADOBECODEBANC", "ABC") → "BANC"
✅ minWindow("a", "a") → "a"
✅ minWindow("a", "aa") → ""
✅ minWindow("", "a") → ""
✅ minWindow("this is a test string", "tist") → "t stri"
✅ minWindow("aaab", "aa") → "aa"
✅ minWindow("Aa", "A") → "A"
✅ minWindow("acbbaca", "aba") → "baca"
✅ minWindow("abc", "d") → ""
✅ minWindow("ADOBECODEBANC", "AABC") → "ADOBECODEBA"
```

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Empty input strings
- ✅ Target longer than source
- ✅ No valid window exists
- ✅ Single character matches
- ✅ Duplicate characters in target
- ✅ Case sensitivity
- ✅ Multiple valid windows (finds minimum)
- ✅ Complex patterns with overlapping characters

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ **Perfect sliding window implementation** with expand/contract logic
- ✅ **Optimal time complexity** O(n) - single pass through string
- ✅ **Efficient space usage** O(k) - only stores character frequencies
- ✅ **Robust edge case handling** - comprehensive coverage
- ✅ **Clean variable naming** - descriptive and clear intent
- ✅ **Correct algorithm flow** - proper window management

### Algorithm Excellence
- **Expansion Phase:** Correctly expands window until all characters matched
- **Contraction Phase:** Efficiently contracts to find minimum valid window
- **State Tracking:** Properly maintains frequency counts and match status
- **Result Storage:** Correctly stores minimum window bounds during traversal

### Implementation Highlights
- Uses `required` to track unique characters needed (not total count)
- Properly handles character frequency matching with `match` counter
- Efficiently stores minimum window bounds (`minL`, `minR`) during traversal
- Correct return logic: empty string when no valid window exists

## Alternative Approaches

### Approach 1: Current Sliding Window (Optimal)
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(k) space
- **Trade-offs:** Best possible performance for this problem
- **Implementation notes:** Perfect balance of efficiency and readability

### Approach 2: Brute Force (Not Recommended)
- **Complexity:** O(n³) time, O(k) space
- **Trade-offs:** Simple but inefficient
- **When to use:** Only for learning basic substring concepts

## Learning Notes

### Pattern Recognition
- **How to identify:** Need minimum/maximum substring with character constraints
- **Common variations:** Fixed vs variable window size, character frequency matching
- **Key insights:** Two pointers with dynamic window expansion/contraction

### Implementation Tips
- Always store best result during traversal (not at the end)
- Use frequency maps for O(1) character lookups
- Track unique characters needed vs total character count
- Handle edge cases: empty inputs, no valid solution

### Common Pitfalls Avoided
- ✅ Correctly uses stored minimum bounds for return value
- ✅ Proper loop termination with `r < s.length`
- ✅ Handles frequency matching with unique character count
- ✅ Efficient window contraction logic
