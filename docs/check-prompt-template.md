# Check Solution Prompt Template

Use this prompt when the user says "check {number}" to analyze and verify solution correctness and efficiency:

## Prompt Template

```
Analyze and verify LeetCode problem #{number} solution with detailed feedback:

1. **Locate Problem Files**:
   - Find {number}_{snake_case_title}.js in appropriate category folder
   - Locate corresponding .test.js and .md files
   - If problem not found, suggest using "gen {number}" first

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - **Implementation Status**: 
     - Check if solution contains only TODO comments (not implemented)
     - Identify exported functions and their names
     - Detect if solution is partial or complete
   
   - **Code Quality Assessment**:
     - Analyze algorithmic approach used (brute force, optimal, etc.)
     - Identify patterns: sliding window, two pointers, hash map, etc.
     - Check for edge case handling (empty inputs, null checks, boundaries)
     - Review variable naming and code clarity

   - **Time & Space Complexity**:
     - Estimate Big O time complexity based on code patterns
     - Identify space complexity considerations
     - Flag potential performance issues (nested loops, inefficient data structures)
     - Compare against optimal solutions if current approach is suboptimal

3. **Test Execution**:
   - Run existing test suite: `pnpm test {test_file}`
   - Report pass/fail status with specific test results
   - For failed tests, provide:
     - Which test cases are failing
     - Expected vs actual outputs
     - Root cause analysis when possible

4. **Detailed Feedback Report**:

### ‚úÖ **SOLUTION STATUS**
- Implementation found: Yes/No
- Functions exported: [list function names]
- Current approach: [describe algorithm/pattern used]

### ‚è±Ô∏è **PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**

- Space complexity: O(?) 
- Performance concerns: [list any issues]

### üß™ **TEST RESULTS**
- Tests passed: X/Y

### üéØ **OVERALL VERDICT**
- ‚úÖ Solution is correct and efficient
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Solution works but could be optimized 
- üîß Solution needs debugging/fixes
- üöß Solution not implemented yet

### üìã **NEXT STEPS**
- If solution is correct: Suggest trying more problems in same category
- If suboptimal: Recommend specific optimizations
- If incorrect: Point to specific issues to debug
- If not implemented: Suggest using "solution {number}" for AI help

## Analysis Guidelines:

### Pattern Recognition:
- **O(n¬≤) indicators**: Nested loops, checking all pairs
- **O(n) indicators**: Single pass, hash map usage, two pointers
- **O(log n) indicators**: Binary search, divide and conquer
- **Space complexity**: Extra data structures, recursion depth

### Common Issues to Flag:
- Nested loops when hash map could achieve O(n)
- Missing null/empty input handling  
- Off-by-one errors in array indexing
- Incorrect edge case handling
- Inefficient string/array operations

### Category-Specific Checks:
- **Sliding Window**: Window expansion/contraction logic
- **Two Pointers**: Pointer movement conditions
- **Dynamic Programming**: Base cases and state transitions
- **Trees/Graphs**: Null checks and traversal correctness

7. **Create Solution Analysis File**:

After completing all analysis, create a comprehensive documentation file:

### File: `{number}_solution.md`
```markdown
